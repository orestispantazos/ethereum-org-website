# Why Eth2?

<Subtitle>In the five years since launch, Ethereum has shown us what’s possible when you combine blockchain technology and software applications to create open, permissionless systems. But Ethereum still needs to scale to fulfil its potential.</Subtitle>

Today, Ethereum handles a tremendous amount of value and it works well. But the design of Eth2 was always the vision – it just wasn't possible at the time Ethereum launched. Eth2 will solve the compromises of [Ethereum 1.0](/what-is-ethereum/).

## Current limitations

### Speed ⚡️

Ethereum can only handle 7 - 15 transactions per second. For comparison Visa processes around 1500. Right now, Ethereum couldn’t handle mainstream adoption.

### Energy 💡

Verifying transactions is currently very energy intensive which isn’t sustainable.

### Opportunity 🏗

The upfront costs of mining equipment means there’s a a substantial financial barrier to participating in the network.

Some blockchains have claimed to solve some or all of these issues. But this is often at the expense of principles that Ethereum won't ever compromise on, like decentralization.

## The Ethereum trilemma

The Ethereum trilemma is that it's inherently difficult to scale a blockchain in a secure, decentralized way.

To make ETH more scalable it will have to be faster and less energy-intensive. This wouldn't be as tricky if you were willing to compromise on decentralization. But when you compromise decentralization you also start to compromise the openness and security of the system. This is a big no, no for Ethereum.

### Secure 🛡

Ethereum needs the same level of security and incentives in place to keep the network safe.

### Decentralized 🌐

Extra scalability and security can’t come at the expense of centralization.

### Scalable 💗

Ethereum needs to handle lots of transactions and meet growing demands without sacrificing performance

Eth2 plans to solve the trilemma with two new additions to Ethereum:

- [Proof of stake](/eth2/proof-of-stake)
- [Shard chains](/eth2/shard-chains)
