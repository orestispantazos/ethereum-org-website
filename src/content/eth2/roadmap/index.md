# Why Eth2?

<Subtitle>The road to Eth2 is long and winding but there are some important checkpoints along the way. </Subtitle>

## Where we are

Currently, teams are building out Eth2 clients and in the process of testing them. A client is a piece of software that serves as a "node" in the Ethereum network, helping to read and validate transactions.

There are many different types of clients because Ethereum encourages a multi-client world. As Danny Ryan puts it, "Ethereum is the abstract set of rules that makes up the protocol rather than any specific implementation of those set of rules".
