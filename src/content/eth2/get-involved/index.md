# Get involved in Eth2

<Subtitle>Eth2, like Ethereum, is a community-driven effort. Take a look to see how you can contribute to the Eth2 effort.</Subtitle>

At this stage, most of the ways to help out with Eth2 are quite technical. That's because we're in the pre-Phase 0 test phase. There'll be more opportunities to get involved with Eth2 as we get further along [the roadmap](/eth2/roadmap/).

## Go bug hunting üêõ {#go-bug-hunting}

One of the best ways to help out right now is to set up a few of the Eth2 clients. Once you're set up and testing, check out the bounty program. You may get rewards if you spot any bugs.

## Attacknets ü§∫

If you're a white-hat hacker you can help out by trying to bring down these purpose-made attacknets. They are four-node versions of the Lighthouse and Prysm clients.

You can now stake G√∂ETH and become a validator for the [Medalla multi-client testnet](https://github.com/goerli/medalla/blob/master/medalla/README.md).

G√∂ETH is ETH running on the G√∂rli testnet. You can get some from the G√∂rli faucet.
