# Proof of stake

<Subtitle>This is a way of processing transactions and creating blocks in a blockchain. In Ethereum right now, this is done via proof-of-work or mining. Proof of stake is considered to be a more sustainable evolution. </Subtitle>

## What is staking?

Staking is the process of committing your ETH to become a validator for Ethereum. A validator is responsible for running software that validates transactions and, when chosen, creates new blocks in the chain. To become a full validator you'll need 32 ETH. However there will be opportunities to offer a smaller stake by joining staking pools.

There will be thousands of validators. And they will keep the network secure by processing the transactions and making sure everyone is using the same data.

### Rewards and penalties

When you successfully validate a transaction you'll be rewarded in ETH, paid by the end user's transaction fees.

However you can also lose your staked ETH if you're not acting in the best interest of the network. You'll lose ETH for bad behaviour like going offline for long periods of time and, of course, deliberately publishing bad data to try and cheat the system.

## How this differs from today

In Ethereum 1.0 miners process transactions and create new blocks. They also have financial incentives not to cheat the system because they are rewarded for every block they add to the chain. Doing this requires large investments in equipment and in energy. If they try and publish data that the rest of the network disagrees with, theyâ€™d never get to create a block and never get their pay out. This made it a very safe process, but an unsustainable one due to energy consumption.
