# Eth2

Eth2 is the Ethereum we all know and love with the upgrade it needs to scale to serve all of humanity. Faster transactions, less congestion, and you don’t need a mining rig to participate. It’s a multi-phase process but the first phase should be with us before the end of 2020.

ETH2.0 will mean faster transactions, less energy consumption, and staking rewards. This is because Ethereum is moving from proof-of-work to a [proof-of-stake blockchain](/eth2/proof-of-stake).

This will mean mining as the way to secure Ethereum and verify transactions.

> If this isn't making sense, we recommend you read up on [Ethereum 1.0](/what-is-ethereum/)

## Latest status

Eth2 is currently in testing so, if you're really bullish, now's the time to help test the latest developments.

### Community updates

Folks from around the community are doing a great job of documenting progress so we recommend you check these out:

## Learn Eth2

If you're here to understand ETH2.0, we'll dive into why it's needed and how it works.

If you're already an ETH holder or dApp developer, you don't need to do anything because it will be compatible with the main Ethereum network you use today. **The ETH you use in ETH2.0 will be the same ETH you own now.**
