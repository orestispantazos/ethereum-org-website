# Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2)

<Subtitle>Eth2 will give Ethereum the upgrade it needs to scale to serve all of humanity. It’s a multi-phase process but the phase 0 should be with us before the end of 2020.</Subtitle>

Eth2 refers to a major upgrade happening to the Ethereum blockchain. This will make transactions faster, reduce energy consumption and introduce staking rewards. Technically speaking, Ethereum will be moving from proof-of-work to a [proof-of-stake](/eth2/proof-of-stake/) blockchain and introducing [shard chains](/eth2/shard-chains/). This is a huge change to how Ethereum works but it should bring equally huge benefits.

## Learn Eth2

If you're here to understand Eth2, we'll dive into why it's needed and how it works.

If you're already an ETH holder or dapp developer, you don't need to do anything because it will be compatible with the main Ethereum network you use today. **You'll be able to use the ETH you own today in Eth2 once it's live.**
